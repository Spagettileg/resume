## UXD Considerations

### User & Business Objectives

#### User
- An all inclusive resume design reminds the user of past, present and future information technology committments 
- Navigation is simple with a quality finishing touch
- Photo image of the developer is clear and professional
- Understand the background to the developer through setting out their credentials
- Work history disclosure helps create a fuller picture of the developers overall capability 

#### Business
- Prospective clients can quickly access information upon capability, skills and achievements
- Web based design makes the resume easily portable
- Content rich design saves prospective clients from repeated or unnecesary calls and emails   

### Wireframes
My wireframe mock-up designs have been created in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to showcase the 'Resume' website responsivenesson mobile, tablet and desktop devices.

•	[Resume](https://github.com/Spagettileg/resume/blob/master/wireframes/resumefinal.zip)

### User Stories

* Personal information and a summary of the developers background to appear on the homepage
* Ease of navigation required to enable the user to move around within the resume wthout getting lost in detail
* Developers image to be personal & professional and to be on show in all important pages of the resume
* A dedicated resume page that includes a work history, skills reference and a summary project portfolio
* Contact with the developer to intorduce new project ideas
* To understand any conferences / meets ups attended and groups / professional societies the developer belongs too 
* Access to the developers GitHub Repository to understand projects worked on with demonstrable evidence of languages used
* User to download the developers latest cv in pdf format
* Dark mode capability will help power saving and user accessibiity

### Colour Palette
Colours used in this project were sourced from [MyColor Space](https://mycolor.space/). Essentially, the colours are seeking to capture a combination of fresh and earthy tones to support the key attrbutes of the developer. Energy, intelligence, innovation and secure.
