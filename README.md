## UXD Considerations

### User & Business Objectives

#### User
- An all inclusive resume design reminds the user of past, present and future information technology committments 
- Navigation is simple with a quality finishing touch

- Work history disclosure helps create a fuller picture of the developers overall capability 

#### Business
- Prospective clients can quickly access information upon capability, skills and achievements
- Web based design makes the resume easily portable
- Content rich design saves prospective clients from repeated or unnecesary calls and emails   

### Wireframes

### CSS Framework
Bootstrap was the chosen framework for styling my project. I used the Bootstrap grid extensively to support responsiveness on mobile, tablet and desktop devices.

### Colour Palette
Colours used in this project were sourced from [MyColor Space](https://mycolor.space/). Essentially, the colours are seeking to capture a combination of fresh and earthy tones to support the key attrbutes of the developer. Energy, intelligence, innovation and secure.
